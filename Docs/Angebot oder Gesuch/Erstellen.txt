1. OfferDetail.vue: 
This file is reponsible to display the offers and the details of the offer when clicked on the "Details" button from the offer card!

2. OfferRequest.vue: 
This file holds the responsibility to request for an offer. Let's say we have User A who clicks on an Offer to request for it, the request will be sent to the creator of the offer who has the leverage to accept or decline the request. Once the request is accepted the users can connect on Facebook and reach to an agreement.
